# whack deez nuts
im gonna turn it into osu cuz why not (i dont play it but would be funny).
edit: this idea sucked bc idk
edit: i mean its not a rhythm game after all, but i still implemented the keyboard input, the only reason i thought of osu

# Why?
- One of the options for the teachers assignment (the others were part of it).
- I thought timing was my worst enemy so i picked this

# What did I learn?
- Nothing much but learned to use frames instead of just request animation frame.

# Features:
- As I said, keyboard input so its a tad bit comfortable.
- A pause menu (my first time btw)
- Hitbox (definetly not my laziness, its for the pros (I actually wonder if there will be pros here))
